# SHL Assessment Recommendation Engine

A rule-based recommendation system that suggests SHL-style psychometric assessments based on:
- Job Title
- Seniority Level
- Use Case (hiring screening, development, or talent review)

This engine uses a structured SHL-style catalogue and a scoring algorithm to intelligently recommend the most relevant assessments. It simulates how Talent Acquisition and HR platforms recommend assessment solutions for specific hiring and development scenarios.
